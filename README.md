# 765_Project

 'decoder-bench' is an open source tool that provides code to evaluate, benchmark, and compare different decoder algorithms for QEC and it is built to work with Stim. This project will aim to expand upon the existing decoder-bench package and add additional capabilities for testing for more error correcting codes, logical operations, lattice surgery or other missing features.
